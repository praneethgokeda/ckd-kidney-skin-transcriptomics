**Author**: Praneeth Gokeda  
**Type**: Systems Biology / RNA-Seq Project  
**Tools**: FastQC, Trim Galore, HISAT2, HTSeq, edgeR(`rna_seq.R`), STRING, Enrichr, Cytoscape

## Abstract

This project explores the shared inflammatory mechanisms in kidney and skin tissues in the context of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). RNA-Seq data analysis revealed differential gene expression and pathway enrichment, identifying **arachidonic acid metabolism** as a central pathway linking both tissues through inflammation-related genes such as **CYP2C**, **ALOX12**, and **PTGS**.

## Data Source

- 3 kidney + 3 skin RNA-Seq samples  
- Source: Human Protein Atlas, Uppsala Biobank  
- Original study: [PMID: 25613900](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613900/)

Raw FASTQ/BAM files are not included due to size. Preprocessing and mapping were performed as described in the report.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Preprocessing**: FastQC + Trim Galore  
2. **Mapping**: HISAT2 (GRCh38 genome)  
3. **Counting**: HTSeq-count  
4. **DEG Analysis**: edgeR in R  (via `rna_seq.R`)
5. **Enrichment**: Enrichr (GO, KEGG), STRING + Cytoscape  
6. **Visualization**: PCA, MDS, BCV, heatmaps, PPI, pathway maps

## Key Results

- 10,043 DEGs identified
  - 5,373 upregulated in kidney
  - 4,670 upregulated in skin
- Common pathway: **Arachidonic acid metabolism**
- Shared inflammatory genes: *ALOX12, PTGS, CYP2C19 (skin)* and *CYP2C, CYP4A11 (kidney)*
- Psoriasis gene signature overlaps with CKD (adj. p = 4.047e-7)

## Running the Script

The R script `rna_seq.R` performs edgeR analysis and generates a heatmap from the count files.
